Heat oil in a wok or pan. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium. This flame range will depend on the heaviness of the pan. For a heavy pan, keep medium flame and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low flame. The oil should have a medium-low heat or having a temperature of 130 to 135 degrees celsius.
Now add the potatoes in the oil. You can fry in two to three batches. I fried in two batches. Do not over crowd the wok (kadai) or pan.
Stir often while frying them for uniform cooking.
Fry till the potatoes get cooked, but they should not brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.
